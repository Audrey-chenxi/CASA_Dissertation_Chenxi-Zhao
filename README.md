## 1.Article structure   
1) Introduction    
-Covid-19 is a global epidemic. Although various countries and the entire society are emphasizing on fighting the covid-19 together, in fact, different regions and groups of people are suffering from different levels of harm caused by the covid-19.  
-There has been a lot of research on covid-19 in London, but it is rarely detailed to specific areas(MSOA).   
（As Covid-19 is a global epidemic, governments in various countries and international organizations have made a lot of efforts. At the beginning, almost all the propaganda was that we would fight against Covid-19 together. However, the fact is that certain people or areas are more susceptible to the virus. For example, ‘Covid triangle’ (three London boroughs) has received a lot of attention due to the high infection and death rate. In Barking and Dagenham, one in 16 people was reported to be infected. 'The virus does discriminate' as well as the adverse impacts of trying to control the pandemic and the economic consequences. Recently published data suggests that the most deprived areas of England have Twice the rate of deaths involving Covid-19 than the most affluent. This inequality of Covid mortality should be worthy of attention and in-depth research, so that the society and government will continue to work hard to reduce the inequality in population health.
There have been many studies on covid-19, but most of them are large and dense. There are very few analyses that have detailed studies on various regions and cities below the country. However, only by understanding the relevant factors in these small regions can we have a more accurate judgment on covid-19 and better reflect on this global epidemic.）  
2) Research question + aim  
3) Literature review  
(1) The overall situation of the global covid-19 + mortality rate + corresponding characteristics  
(2) The overall situation of the UK & London covid-19 + mortality rate+ corresponding characteristics  
4) Presentation of data  
5) Explanation of methodology  
6) Presentation of results  
-a-Different time: spatial comparison and inequality of Covid-19 mortality during two lockdowns. A London with two pandemics?  
  UK epidemic policy at various time periods: https://www.honglingjin.co.uk/338580.html#2021%E5%B9%B45%E6%9C%88  
-b-Different regions: the relationship between socio-demographic factors and mortality inequality. And how this relationship differed in two lockdowns  
7) Discussion of results
(1) Covid-19 has improved and is expected to return to normal in June. There is still regional inequality in vaccine injections during this process
(2) Compare the overall situation in England and other health inequalities, analyze government policies, social phenomena and give some suggestions. Address inequalities in population health
8) Conclusions
