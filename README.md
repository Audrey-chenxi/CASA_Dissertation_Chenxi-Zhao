## 4.Article structure
1）Introduction 
-covid-19作为全球流行病，虽然各个国家和地区都在强调共同抵抗疫情，但实际上是不同地区和不同人群承受着疫情带来的不同级别的伤害
-对于covid-19的研究一直都很多，但很少细化到具体区域
（As Covid-19 is a global epidemic, governments in various countries and international organizations have made a lot of efforts. At the beginning, almost all the propaganda was that we would fight against Covid-19 together. However, the fact is that certain people or areas are more susceptible to the virus. For example, ‘Covid triangle’ (three London boroughs) has received a lot of attention due to the high infection and death rate. In Barking and Dagenham, one in 16 people was reported to be infected. 'The virus does discriminate' as well as the adverse impacts of trying to control the pandemic and the economic consequences. Recently published data suggests that the most deprived areas of England have Twice the rate of deaths involving Covid-19 than the most affluent. This inequality of Covid mortality should be worthy of attention and in-depth research, so that the society and government will continue to work hard to reduce the inequality in population health.
There have been many studies on covid-19, but most of them are large and dense. There are very few analyses that have detailed studies on various regions and cities below the country. However, only by understanding the relevant factors in these small regions can we have a more accurate judgment on covid-19 and better reflect on this global epidemic.）

Background：
Covid-19作为一个全球性的流行病，各个国家的政府、国际组织都做出了很很多努力。在起初，几乎所有的宣传都是我们会在一起共同抗击Covid-19，然而事实情况是某些人群或者地区更容易受到病毒的感染。比如‘Covid triangle’ (three London boroughs)因为很高的感染和死亡率等到了很大的关注。In Barking and Dagenham, one in 16 people was reported to be infected.‘the virus does discriminate’ as well as the adverse impacts of trying to control the pandemic and the economic consequences. Recently published data suggests that the most deprived areas of England have twice the rate of deaths involving Covid-19 than the most affluent. 这种Covid mortality的不平等性应该值得关注并做出深入的研究，让社会和政府不断的努力去减小人口健康中的不平等现象。
对于covid-19的研究一直都很多，但大多数都是研究large and dense。很少有细化研究国家以下各个地区和城市的分析。然而只有了解了这些小区域的关联因素才能对covid-19有更准确的判断，更好的反思这场全球性的流行病。


methodological ：
根据本文的data size and purpose，选择OLS regressions作为方法分析每个borough characteristic。这些characteristic有的属于同一个factor，有的属于不同的factors。比如财富特征这个factor会包括人均GDP，收入等。And final model including all explanatory variables together. 与此同时会用一些空间分析方法去解释空间数据，如用莫兰指数去验证空间自相关性。也会用可视化的手段更直观的展现数据，进行辅助分析。
According to the data size and purpose of this article, choose OLS regressions as the method to analyze each borough characteristic. Some of these characteristics belong to the same factor, and some belong to different factors. For example, the factor of wealth status would include per capita GDP, income, etc. And final model including all explanatory variables together. At the same time, some spatial analysis methods will be used to interpret spatial data, such as Moran index to verify spatial autocorrelation. It will also use visual means to display the data more intuitively and perform auxiliary analysis.
